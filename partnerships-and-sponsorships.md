At Massive, we attempt to maintain editorial independence and are transparent about relationships we have with our partners and sponsors.

We publish two types of content in addition to our original, scientist-authored media:

- **Co-produced content**, made cooperatively by Massive Science and a partner organization
- **Sponsored content**, made _by or expressly on behalf of_ an advertiser and compensated by an advertiser

As we continue to amend our sponsorship, partnership and advertising policies we will maintain transparency with our readers and community.
